<!-- I'm trying to explain how I and why I work the way I do...
Ideation -> Implementation -> Validation -> Repeat. -->

Starting to work on an idea or a project always bring some challanges with it. Sometimes the path is clear and you can do a **best practice** approach. _Building an API does not mean that you have to necessarily invent how APIs work entirely new. You can build on top of the existing._
Sometimes howevery, you have to explore new territories.
For me this means you have to be able to bring a idea quick, so that you have an artifact on which you can iterate on.
I mostly use modern **JavaScript** for this process. It gives me the scope of development outline concepts either on the frontend with e.g. **ReactJS** or **React-Native** or implement a sketch of a backend service in a **Node.js** environment. By using **ECMA Script** in this manner shifting features from back- to frontend and vice versa enables me create **functional prototypes** relativly fast. Reducing development time using this approach and _automating the in-between steps_ also means, I have more time to explore other approaches and paths to _open up the space for options_ to discuss.

Since some of the projects are not always about building a digital service, _visualizing complex information_ in a meaningful way by analysing data sources or _building physical objects_ for **Edge-Computing** and **IoT** related work.

<!-- I mostly use **javascript** based code to bring digital projects to life. Currently **reactjs** and **react native** are the frontend frameworks\* I am using most of the time. In past and current projects I used **threejs**, **SASS**, **webpack**, **mapbox GL JS** and other tools. For backend services **node.js** is my comfort zone but if **data analysis** is involved, I switch to **Python** if needed. Previously I worked with PHP, AngularJS, Swift and Java (mostly Android).
Being able to work with **ES6+** on all ends of the code allows me to seamlessly transfer features from front- to backend and vice versa. Developing **functional prototypes** with this approach and hooking the components into a **CI/CD** pipeline, that handles the build and delivery to **Docker** and **Kubernetes** based **AWS** infrastructure, streamlines the process and saves me more time.
When building IoT products & prototypes or services in the **edge computing** domain I use **micro-controllers** and **SBCs** like **Arduino**, **raspberry pi** or **nVidia Jetson**. -->
