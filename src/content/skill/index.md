I mostly use **javascript** based code to bring digital projects to life. Currently **reactjs** and **react native** are the frontend frameworks\* I am using most of the time. In past and current projects I used **threejs**, **SASS**, **webpack**, **mapbox GL JS** and other tools. For backend services **node.js** is my comfort zone but if **data analysis** is involved, I switch to **Python** if needed. Previously I worked with PHP, AngularJS, Swift and Java (mostly Android).
Being able to work with **ES6+** on all ends of the code allows me to seamlessly transfer features from front- to backend and vice versa. Developing **functional prototypes** with this approach and hooking the components into a **CI/CD** pipeline, that handles the build and delivery to **Docker** and **Kubernetes** based **AWS** infrastructure, streamlines the process and saves me more time.
When building IoT products & prototypes or services in the **edge computing** domain I use **micro-controllers** and **SBCs** like **Arduino**, **raspberry pi** or **nVidia Jetson**.
