<!-- I'm trying to explain how I and why I work the way I do...
Ideation -> Implementation -> Validation -> Repeat. -->

The projects I'm working on are not always about building digital services. _Visualizing complex information_ in a meaningful way by analysing different data sources or _building physical objects_ for **Edge-Computing** & **IoT Design** are also fields I'm enthusiastic about.

When **exploring new ideas** and projects, I have to work out whether I need to **discover, build and validate** the technology or whether I can use existing tools and processes for a **best practice** approach. _Most of the times it is something in the middle._

For me this means you have to be able to bring a idea quick, so that you have an artifact on which you can iterate on.
I mostly use modern **JavaScript** for this process. It gives me the freedom of outlining concepts either at the user-facing side with e.g. **ReactJS** or **React-Native** or to implement a sketch of a backend service in a **Node.js** environment. By using **ECMA Script** in this manner, shifting features from back- to frontend and vice versa enables me create **functional prototypes** quickly. By _automating the in-between steps_ with different tools, I have more time to explore other approaches and paths to _open up the space for options_ to discuss.

The main goal I'm trying to do is to **find problems** by using technology in order to _figure out possible solutions_.
