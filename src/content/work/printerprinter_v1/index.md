Printerprinter v1 (formely thing for the internet) is the attempt to **connect the digital and physical world**.
By sending short messages from a companion **Ionic** app to the **raspberry pi** connected thermal printer, the information transforms from a digital asset to a physical one and has no dependencies to the digital world anymore.
