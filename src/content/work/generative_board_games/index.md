Generative Board Games is an exploration in the intersection between **artificial intelligence** and **creativity**. By using a **GPT-2** model, trained on over thousand board-game rules, we are able to generate unique instructions to never exisiting boardgames. Additionally to the instructions, a **StyleGAN** model generates the cover to the new game. You just have to provide a name to a game you want to play and let the AI do the rest.
