I build and explore technology in order to find and solve problems.'

Florian writes code and builds stuff at the move lab. He is the connecting piece between concept and implementation.

Florian uses technology as a gateway to explore new ways of solving problems. He creates digital and physical prototypes that spark interest and create ideas in other people's heads. After graduating at the Media University in Stuttgart and taking a short detour to Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences he arrived at the lab.

When Florian is not tinkering with everything that has a microchip on it, he enjoys shooting some 3-pointers or at least trying to.
